# ESP32-CAM-IMAGE-RECOGNITION-IMAGE-PROCESSING

I always wanted to try something new with esp32 cam , so i challenged myself with this small project which is image recognition.
The key features of this project are:
1)you can take a picture from the ESP32 CAM (inbuilt feature! I didn't reinvent the wheel)
2)The captured image will be sent to tensorflow JS algorithm for classification result
3)You can upload any image using the image url and get it classified by tensorflow js (I made this :)   )

The tools or resources i have used for this project are as below

1)Code editor-- Bracketsüñä
2)ESP32 CAM (ofcourse! without it no life for this project)‚ù§Ô∏è
3)tensorflow js (java script library)
4)Bootstrap 4.5 (to get rid of ugly homepage of esp32 cam)
5)HTML to Hex code --:  https://t.ly/jxAY

6) Arduino IDE
7)ESP8266 (for code uploading to esp32 cam)

#note:
I haven't changed much in the source code that comes with esp32, instead i just disabled/commented all the UI/js functions as per my project needs, incase if you wish to switch
to native code of esp32cam , just upload the fresh sketch from arduino ide and you are all good to go.

This is project might have updates in the future, as i have a very interesting project in my mind. If you wish to reach out to me for any queries or support please contact
me in instagram @wired_ai

Thank you for your time.
